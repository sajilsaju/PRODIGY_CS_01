## Encryption and Decryption of messages using Caesar Cypher algorithm.
This repository contains a a python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm and also, allow users to input a message and shift value to perform encryption and decryption.
## How It Works

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

### Features
- Encrypts a given text with a specified shift value.
- Decrypts a given text with the original shift value.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sajilsaju/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
